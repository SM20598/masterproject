GENERATE EQUATIONS OF MOTION (EOM):

	The project offers two ways of deriving the equations of motion, a PYTHON sided generation
	and a MATLAB/C++ sided generation.

1) PYTHON:

	The file EOMTool.py is a class which generates the EOM using sympy library. It saves the
	variables in a dictionary 'self.segment' which can be access later.
	
	WARNING: It is not recommended to use the Python sided generation, as the derivation takes
		 very long with sympy's simplify function. If simplification is left out the terms
		 will become extremely large and not optimized leading to extremly long processing
		 times. Even simplifying generates inefficient variables which will be to slow for
		 actual application.

2) MATLAB/C++:
	
	The matlab script 'derive_EOM_VARIABLES.m' follow the Newton-Euler-Formalism and generates
	the relevant Matrices and Vectors according to the defined Softrobot configuration.

		JT : translational Jacobian J_T(y, t)
		a_ : local translational acceleration a^_(y, dy, t)
		JR : rotational Jacobian J_R(y, t)
		wrcl : angular velocity (in matrix form) w^~(y, dy, t)
		alpha_ : local rotational acceleration alpha^_(y, dy, t)
		
	The variables are saved as 'matlabfunctions' in "varname_numseg_curseg.m". Then 'codegen'
	generates C++ files/libraries. The two general cpp and header files (example for Jacobian:
	JT_2_1.cpp & JT_2_1.h) contain the desired function to calculate the desired variable. Copy
	both files into the desired C++ project and edit the following (example for Jacobian):
	
		in JT_2_1.cpp:
		
			- remove line '#include "rt_nonfinite.h"' in JT_2_1.cpp
			- add lines 
				
				#include "limits"
					
				- replace 'rtNaN;' with 'std::numeric_limits<double>::quiet_NaN();'
				- replace 'rtInf;' with 'std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity();'
		
		in JT_2_1.h:
		
			- remove lines:
				
				#include "rtwtypes.h"
				#include <cstddef>
				#include <cstdlib>
